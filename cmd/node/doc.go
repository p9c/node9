/*Package node is a full-node Parallelcoin implementation written in Go.

The default options are sane for most users.  This means pod will work 'out of the box' for most users.  However, there are also a wide variety of flags that can be used to control it.

The following section provides a usage overview which enumerates the flags.
An interesting point to note is that the long form of all of these options (
except -C/--configfile and -D --datadir) can be specified in a configuration
file that is automatically parsed when pod starts up.
By default, the configuration file is located at ~/.pod/pod.
conf on POSIX-style operating systems and %LOCALAPPDATA%\pod\pod.
conf on Windows.
The -D (--datadir) flag, can be used to override this location.
